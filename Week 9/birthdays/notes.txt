In application.py, query for all birthdays and pass that data to index.html

In index.html, render each birthday as a row in the table
Table row = tr tag
Cell = td tag
run loop to process all  rows
Should be able to view all rows in database now

In index.html, add a form to let users add a new birthday

In application.py, when the form submission is received, insert the birthday into the database


To run SQL queries on database use db.execute

GET = takes data from the URL for displaying details on a page
POST = for writing data to the database
