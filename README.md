This is my collection of problems from the Harvard CS50x Introduction to Computer Science

In the cource you are given a Brief of what the code must do. You are then given some boiler plate code to begin with to allow you to get straight to the problem.

I found the course to be a great learning experience and would reccomend anyone who is thinking about computer science to give it a go.

If you are also completing CS50 please only use these to get an idea of how one person executed the solution and DO NOT direct copy paste. If you do you will rob yourself a powerfull learning opertunity
